    cairo_matrix_t — Generic matrix operations
    Error handling — Decoding cairo's status
    Version Information — Compile-time and run-time version checks.
 
Unfinished:
 Paths — Creating paths and manipulating path data
   Context related methods are done
   TODO: CairoPath needs iterator and destructor/constructor implemented
 Text — Rendering text and glyphs
   TODO: all, nothing has been started
 
 Fonts: Very little has been done on any of this, basically enough to be able to return objects out of context/surface calls
	cairo_font_face_t — Base class for font faces
	cairo_scaled_font_t — Font face at particular size and options
	cairo_font_options_t — How a font should be rendered
	FreeType Fonts — Font support for FreeType
	Win32 Fonts — Font support for Microsoft Windows
	Quartz (CGFont) Fonts — Font support via CGFont on OS X
	User Fonts — Font support with font data provided by the user

Surfaces: PS will be easy, the others will require some interesting additions
    PostScript Surfaces — Rendering PostScript documents
    Win32 Surfaces — Microsoft Windows surface support
    Quartz Surfaces — Rendering to Quartz surfaces
    XLib Surfaces — X Window System rendering using XLib

1. Finish code completion (see above)

2. Tests written (good code coverage wanted)

3. Documentation

4. address issues with extended classes set into and returned out of cairo calls
