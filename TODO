CairoPath needs some help, toStr should be a __toString, there are a bunch of functions missing and
it should probably have iteration implemented for it

Tests and documentation need to be written

when 1.7 is released new toys need to be added, at the same time the build system will probably need
versioning added so we know what version of cairo we're building against

Individual surfaces need a once over and there are some unimplemented or partially implemented functions (a list?)
