Cairo for PHP 8
=============

Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. Output
targets include the X Window System (via both Xlib and XCB), Quartz, Win32,
image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG files.

This extension provides access to Cairo functionality in PHP8 in the Cairo namespace.

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/swen100/cairo.svg?branch=php8)](https://app.travis-ci.com/swen100/cairo)

Requirements
=============
 * PHP 8.0.0+
 * Cairo 1.12.0+
 * [Eos\DataStructures](http://github.com/eos-org/datastructures) 1.0.1

Additional features are supported up to Cairo version 1.16.2

Features are enabled at compile time based on the library version they are compiled against.

Documentation and information about the underlying library can be found at [cairographics.org](http://cairographics.org/manual/)

Installation
=============
There are plans to make this available via [pecl](http://pecl.php.net) and [pickle](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/pickle)
But this is currently the unstable PHP7 version

Until then, please compile and install the both the datastructures and the cairo extensions and enable them in your php.ini file

```
extension=eos_datastructures.so
extension=cairo.so
```

Compile
=============

This extension can be compiled and tested using phpize

First you need to make and install the Eos\DataStructures extension, which provides Enum support

The cairo extension also requires cairo development files.  You can build the package
manually or use your system's package manager.  For example on ubuntu use

```
apt-get install libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev fontconfig libjpeg-dev
```

Then you can use phpize to install the extension against your current PHP install

```
phpize
./configure
make && make test && make install
```

If you want to use a non-standard location for your PHP use

```
/path/to/phpize
./configure --with-php-config=/path/to/php-config
make && make test && make install
```

`make install` copies `cairo.so` to the right location, but you still need to enable the module
in your php.ini file.
